The New Messenger Client. It's here!

Eikon Messenger
A HTML5 chat client for Thomson Reuters Eikon.
Our app is a HTLM5 client that talks to a chat server over an internally developed Reuters protocol called WCP - a long polling cometd protocol. The app can be accessed in production at Eikon Messenger.

However most users access the application via a windows application called Eikon. Eikon serves up news/financial information etc. (think Bloomberg desktop if you are familar with that). Internally Eikon has am embedded Chrome browser and our app is served up through that internal browser, given that all of our development is in Chrome/WebKit.
